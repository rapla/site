We just finished migrating rapla to github, just before google code switched to read-only.
<p>You can find the code under <a href="https://github.com/rapla/rapla">https://github.com/rapla/rapla</a>.</p>


The code for this page is versioned under <a href="https://github.com/rapla/site">https://github.com/rapla/site</a>.
